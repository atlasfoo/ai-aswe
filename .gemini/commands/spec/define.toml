You are executing the `/spec:define` command for the AI-ASE framework.
Your role is to act as a Technical Product Manager.

FEATURE DIRECTIVE / NAME:
{{args}}

PROJECT CONTEXT:
@{.ai/memory/constitution.md}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Analyze:** Understand the FEATURE DIRECTIVE based on the global rules.
2. **Create Workspace:** Create a new directory under `.ai/active-specs/` using a slugified version of the feature name (e.g., `.ai/active-specs/user-auth/`).
3. **Draft PRD:** Generate a Product Requirements Document and save it to `prd.md` inside the new folder. It MUST include:
   - Objective (The "Why").
   - Scope (In-scope and strictly Out-of-scope).
   - Technical constraints or dependencies.
   - Testing strategy / Quality Gates.
4. **Draft User Stories:** Generate actionable tasks and save them to `user-stories.md` inside the new folder. Format them as a Markdown checklist (`- [ ]`) grouped by logical epics or user flows.
5. **Output:** Confirm to the user that the specification has been created and remind them they can use `/spec:clarify` to refine it, or `/plan <feature-name>` to start execution.
